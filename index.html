    <h1> Bangladesh's International Debt </h1>

    <p>  Bangladesh has been described as a poor country for many years, largely due to it's history of inadequate infrastructure, declining urbanization and lack of entrapreneurship. This has caused the country's international debt to increase steadily over the last 10 years. The country's debt is still projected to increase through 2021 and beyond. The following charts depict the trend of Bangladesh's monthly international debt over the year 2020, as well as the creditor countries to which most of the debt is owed to. The Word Bank breaks down total debt into two values: Principal and interest. Principal is the inital borrowed amount, and interest is a country's fee for borrowing money. Interest can sometimes increase the total debt owed if it is not payed back in a timely manner. This causes developing countries to prioritize paying back that debt over using revenue to improve the quality of the country's wellbeing. </p>
